      " David, did you solve this problem?  So just like the original state, there could be five moves that come out of this.  Two of the moves we can already say are illegal.  Moving two guards would have more prisoners than guards on the left,  and moving one guard and one prisoner would end up with too many prisoners on the right.  So we don't include those states.  Then our three legal moves are to move one prisoner, two prisoners, or one guard.  But now I notice that this state is actually identical to this state.  Like we said before, once we're in a state, we don't really care how we got there,  so going back to an earlier state is not a productive move.  So we can rule this out as an unproductive move.  Similarly, this state is the same as this state.  So we can rule this out as an unproductive move as well.  That leaves us with only one legal productive move  that can follow from the previous state.  That is a very good point, David.  So this representation is a good representation for this problem  because it is making all the constraints of the problem solving explicit.  So that we can quickly compare states and  see which moves are productive and which moves are not productive.  I can tell you that when I tried to solve this problem on my own,  it took me a while because I didn't recognize the fact that I kept going  around in a circle because I didn't realize I kept coming back to the exact  same state.  In fact, David, most of us have the same difficulty.  So the power of this semantic network as a representation is arising because  that allows us to systematically solve this problem because it makes all the  constraints, all the objects, all the relationships, all the moves very explicit.\n"
